0,"Self Contempt, Death Instinct, and 90 days binge",DANCING_PHILOSOPHER,"*“Besides the instinct to preserve living substance and to join it into ever larger units, there must exist another, contrary instinct seeking to dissolve those units and to bring them back to their primeval, inorganic state.” – Sigmund Freud*

Many of us know that **seeking pleasure** is the predominant motive in Freudian psychology that can explain human nature. Adlerian psychology denies that, so does Logotherapy: from these perspectives pleasure is not the main, or at least not the only, driven force for a human being. But not many know that Freud himself wrote one of his last works called **“Beyond the Pleasure Principle”** where he revises his life work, psychoanalysis, from the opposite standpoint - **“ego-instinct”,** **instinct of death**. I am speculating that all sorts of self destructive thoughts, thinking less of myself, pessimism, nihilism, cowardice, self compassion, self pity, etc. are the expression of that **“ego-instinct”.** 

Disliking myself, thinking less of myself was, conviction that I am incapable of this and that, the expression and strongest voice of *decadence, decaying life, weakness* were the *predominant force that made me drink*.

In my case, drinking for 90 days straight was the expression of that beyond principle. I was just **hating myself** and wanted to **hate even more**. As if I got tremendously friendly with that self-destructive force to amplify that feeling, to rebel against life itself: if I can’t be happy, I will be so unbearably unhappy that the world will moan and whine. Each of those days I would wake up, look in the mirror to affirm that I am a piece of shit, and with a sense of accomplishment I would start my day, of course with a glass of wine.  

**Hangover mornings are the best test on self-love.** It is undoubtedly impossible to have even a bit of self-respect at those moments. For some reason I have very intimate feelings about life itself. What a mystery! In my case it is not forced love to myself that keeps me fighting, it is this love to life that makes me still breath. I just don’t want it to be ashamed of me, as its exemplar. I know if I can do it, we both will be proud of this impossible victory of **Poetry over Chemistry**! Words and thoughts that inspire against molecules and chemicals that develop addiction–what a challenge! Idealism against materialism–laughably little chances for success, that is a task for me, let’s do it! 

Some day, on a hangover morning, I remember laying in bed and despite all the neglect, all the loathing, all the contempt, the sense of misery I told myself that I still somehow **want to live** and even love myself. For true love is not love for something, **true love is unconditional**!

*“You look up when you wish to be exalted, I look down because I am exalted” – Friedrich Nietzsche*

For many people boosting their self respect might be contraindicated, so they don’t blow up themselves with narcissism. But for many alcoholics, those who struggle with complete lack of self respect, self love should be prescribed in unlimited dosage. **We should love ourselves mercilessly!**

2,Cravings and Triggers,Shamelesssteelxo,"I gotta stop letting things I can’t control bother me/ drive me to drink. It’s not right, and it’s not like every inconvenience calls for a drink.

Focusing on accepting and resisting right now. Feel very tested by life atm, but doesn’t it always feel that way when you want to quit the most? 

I’m driven to stay alcohol free and focus on myself, not others. I realize I’ve been neglecting myself for years and I have a lot of work to do. I’m glad I’m taking myself into consideration now and doing my best to be a functional human being without alcohol. Cause let’s face it, that wasn’t functional, it was a strange way to live and I never want to go back.

As I got heavier into it, I saw more and more shit I never thought I would. I did shit I told myself I never would. Lying, stealing, inappropriate behaviours (rather it be a violent/verbal outburst, hitting on people with no interest, the list of humiliation goes on). I’m glad I care more about myself now and I’m trying my best to be the best person I know how to be.

7,Please help me!,Think_Zucchini,"I am a 20 year old male. I was prescribed Vyvanse starting at 11 years old and have taken it ever since. Within 3 years(~14 years old) I had increased from 30 mg to 70 mg. Around 16 years old, my Vyvanse was not doing what it used to, which led me to start doubling up here and there. As school got tougher, I started abusing my Vyvanse more and more. By the time the end of senior year rolled around, I was doubling up almost every school day. I hadn’t realized how much of a problem I had on my hands until after I graduated high school. My relationship with this drug is very complex in that I am very prone to abusing it but I also need it. I’ve thought about and tried just stopping all together but my life would quickly unravel. But when I have a prescription, I almost can’t help myself to double up here and there. By the end of every month I am around 5 pills short and it’s hell. Every month I tell myself never again just to do it again. I need help but I am scared because if I open up to the wrong person, I will no longer be allowed to take Vyvanse because I’m deemed a risk for abuse. That terrifies me more than anything because I have been on this pill for half of my life and have taken it through all my years of my brain developing and I’m afraid my brain is now hard wired in a way that requires Vyvanse to function properly. But I know that I can’t keep abusing my medication or I’m going to have serious health issues. I think I have stimulant use disorder and I don’t know what to do about it because I only know of 2 options and they are both horrifying.

Option A: Stop getting prescribed Vyvanse and face devastating effects in on my life from severe depression, emotional dis regulation, extreme fatigue, and uncontrolled ADHD symptoms for who knows how long.

Or

Option B: Continue to be prescribed Vyvanse and keep trying to handle the compulsions on my own, which for the last 2 years have failed again and again. This option is dangerous to my health long term as vyvanse abuse is slowly damaging my heart, blood vessels, and brain. Despite knowing this, I still can’t seem to resist the temptation to double up. 

I want to be myself again. I wish I had never started Vyvanse. My life would have been so much different. But I need help and I have nobody to reach out to. Please if you have any advice, let me know! Or if you have been in a similar situation yourself with Vyvanse and overcame it, what did you do? Thank you.",2,2,-0.06350877192982458

11,Anticipatory Pleasure and Cravings,DANCING_PHILOSOPHER,"*“He who has no meaning distracts himself with pleasures” – Viktor Frankl*

This is the second **polemic essay** and is my speculation. In Logotherapy, there is a notion of anticipatory anxiety, which is in essence a fear of an event in the future that leads us to perceive the event in precisely the light we are already anticipating it. Stimulation of the cause that leads to the effect - triggers. I am speculating about **anticipatory pleasure,** which is affirming ourselves that we want the pleasure, which leads us to cravings.

In the days of Christmas this feeling might escalate drastically. I see all over the place, in social media, how the fellow strugglers adapt to it by making imitated beverages from the bottles that look like alcohol bottles. I sincerely hope that the pleasure will not be imitated.

I remember well being in these situations when I was the only one who doesn’t drink at the table and trying to convince myself that I am enjoying the party. To say the least, it was quite a boring experience. The only exciting moments are when someone tries to be witty and slick a joke about my recovery.

*“The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.” – Oscar Wilde*

Hard to disagree with the quote above. What helps me is despising hedonism. I value lifetime fulfillment more than pleasure (so if pleasure goes across the fulfillment and I cannot take both, I choose fulfillment), although I am not trying to restrain all pleasures of life; and I am denying to myself that alcohol is pleasure in the first place.

In contrast to anticipatory anxiety, **anticipatory pleasure** is stimulating the effect that leads to the cause - cravings. So, denying the belief that I need that specific pleasure is the first step for me to avoid cravings.

14,I can still choose joy. It's up to me.,DryMntnMama,"https://i.imgur.com/yhJTnQI.png
Everything is not okay right now. It just isn't- the holidays are heavy with sadness and grief and missing family members. I'm not in the mood for all the usual Christmas traditions. The lights, the gifts, the decorations, the baking... they all seem to highlight the sadness.


But here's the thing. Everything can be not okay, and I can still appreciate the little moments. Like my teenage daughter wanting to go out to the forest to pick out a Christmas tree. The laughter and giggles and frozen toes and noses... a bright spot, a little bit of lightness. I can choose to grab onto that sweet moment and let it lighten the heaviness for a little while.


I could use the sadness as a reason to drink. Or I could choose to stay sober, and appreciate the happy little moments. I can choose to feel the sadness so I can move through it, or I could numb it for awhile while it destroys me from the inside. 


I choose sober. I choose joy. 


If you're struggling this holiday season, know that you're not alone. We're all in this together. Reach out. And know there's always an Other Side to what you're feeling right now. Take care of yourselves. You are worth it. ",10,2,0.013474025974025984
16,Two weeks clean on Monday! But trying to figure out what “clean” means to me,degenerateautist69,"Two weeks California sober on Monday! Hell yeah. I didn’t really have a habit of anything in particular but couldn’t keep a bag of powder in my pocket. Two weeks ago I had a seizure after a cocaine binge and it scared the shit out of me.

I want to say I don’t miss the drugs. I don’t miss spending all that money, I don’t miss the 5am bullshit conversations in strangers’ kitchens, I don’t miss the packs of cigarettes I’d smoke through. But if someone put it in front of me I don’t think I could say no.

My solution to this has been to separate from the people I was around. Which for the most part has been a healthy transition. But I do miss some of my friends, and I really, really miss the concert scene.

Do I even really want to be sober? I really just don’t want to have any more medical scares. What if I indulge at a friend’s house but don’t do it at home? Is letting myself “scratch the itch” potentially going to help with long term life recovery or is it just going to set me back into previous cycles? Ketamine was great for my depression, but can I be responsible around it without binging?

I don’t really know what to do. But I miss my friends, I miss music, I miss having fun. 

And I miss drugs.",20,22,0.18875000000000003

22,who else was normal before drugs?,Heavy_Goal_8698,"So before drugs I had a pretty normal life all besides the fact my dad was an alcoholic, my step mom was a crack head(that story is on here) and the father of my kids was a herion addict. I was however a pot head but still kept up with all the stuff that comes with being a young mother. I had graduated high school with 5 years, and then I went on to a vocational school and got certified as a home health aid. I then had a few odd jobs, I didnt know what I could do with this certificate. I was working in a factory when I saw this ad abot a kid needing help in the mornings before school and it was for this company out of michigan, I went for it and then became a representitive with that company. I would go to peoples houses and tell them why they should hire our company to take care of there loved one. so I did that which was part time and then I found a job with a agency. I worked in a home of 3 people in wheelchairs they were all full time care. I sometimes did the night shift but I would have rather had the dinner shift. I worked there for awhile followed by a few more agencies and I met and fell in love with alot of people. I worked with both elderly and disabled, kids and even adults. I loved what I did and I didnt even know I was getting myself into this kind of work, I immedialtly loved my job. The problem with that is the agency you work for. I hated it and I hated how they treated us caregivers. 

Backstory:I have a best friend lets call her sue, we had been friends since the fourth grade she was a wild child for sure, her home life sucked, and she was absoluley beautiful. I was like family to her and her family including her moms sister (aunt) Gloria. Gloria was the definition of a BOSS LADY. She had own cleaning buisness that cleaned big offices at night and  she worked a full time job sitting at a desk and she also had 2 adult boys that were both disabled one more than the other bur everyday she lived her life to the fullest and does what she could to take care of her family. She was newly divorced to a cruel man that hit her, cheated and was just evil. She and I had always hit it off and when I saw her again as adults I just knew I would end up working for her. 

So Im in a part of my life where I was lost this was before my drugs use and I had been talking to Gloria for a few days about cleaning. So we go meet and she tells me how to work the office and all the what to do and how to dos and from then on 3 times a week im cleaning 2 or 3 different offices for her. This was hardly a good paying job, I had 3 kids I was taking care of, plus my herion addict boyfriend. (kids father more about him in other stories) I would go a few hours at night after hours and make like 8 or 9 and hour so it really wasnt much. I still needed more work, I needed to figure something out and that when she brought up becoming an Independent Care Provider for the state. This would mean I billed medicaid, I found my own clients and I worked my own hours.Since I already had my own clients, her 2 boys all I had to do was go through the process to get certified. I did it, I paid the money I took the tests, I took the backround test. Then one day november 202014 I got the email. I finally got my  number, I was finally cerified as an Indepedent. I worked my ass of to build a better life and at that time I had it all, I had 3 beautiful babies, a good job that I loved and great hours, and I had finally got the courage to kick eric to the curb so I was doing it all me. It was me and one other person taking care of the boys just while Gloria was at work but there became a point in Glorias life where she wanted to live her own. She had a great boyfriend that offered her the world and she wanted a day a second some time for herself. I always had respect for her and I 100% understood why she wanted to move the boys out into her grandmothers house she was left her her passing.She decided that was gonna be what was best for the boys to have a quality life and be as independent as they can. So we move the boys into a home and now this means we need now an army because wen dont just need the 7am to 3pm and the other comes at 3 tp what 10pm and they couldnt be alone at night, they were around the clock care. The only thing to do was to hire an agency to pick up the lack of me and the other prover. One by one came and I took them through a normal day and night and what they needed what this or that means and so on. I spent a few hours with a few of these women and they decide to go tell there boss whatever they told them. Turns out the agency was after me and the other providers hours, they wanted full control of that house and they got their wish. That is why Gloria called me and let me go. Tina (stepmom) was refusing to watch my kids because I pressed charges on her for stealing my car. I had been scrounging to find babysitters for about a week at that time and I figured I was gonna loose my job anyway. I felt defeated after the agency came into play, I just thought I was gonna continue making good great money and live this amazing life. Out of nowhere back to step one. I was living with my father and step mother at this time and this goes back to the story of ""My step mom is a crack head"". it explains what happened. wow so much more..

23,why I relapsed after 8 months,Heavy_Goal_8698,"An important life changing event for me was when I relapsed after 8months of being clean.

When I left rehab I ended up going to jail for a while. I had found out that my kids father lets call him eric was arrested and in jail a couple counties over. That night I wrote him, we had been on and off for over 4 years so it was a comfort thing writting him, maybe feeling lonley, I knew he was toxic and bad for me but I needed to know he was ok. So we write back and fourth for a week or two and the day came where they let me out. I had every intention on staying clean, I wanted a better life and jail gave me a different perspective of life. I got out on a thursday and called erics jail friday to set up a visit for sunday. Well, Sunday came and I couldnt get there I had to cancel, little did I know eric was getting out Monday morning. I had no idea he was even out and if I did know I think I could have helped him in some way. I remember it like it was yesterday.. I was gathering my laundry to take to my moms and I was planning on having dinner there and catch up. I pull up to my moms and everyone is there, it was weird, erics dad and step mom and my grandma and grandpa was there to.I walked up to the pourch where everyone was standing with caution knowing deep down in my soul he had finally done it. (backstory eric was addicted to herion and has been for years at that point. I talk about him in other stories and our story will be written eventually when I am ready.) Eric had been out of jail for less than 2 days, this was Wednsday, and he had overdosed in his moms bathroom. I was 8 months clean the longest I had ever been clean and something just came over me. I dropped the baskets I was holding and immediatley thought of my 2 beautiful kids we made together, my heart just broke. They were young both under 6 so they dont remember much but they do know there daddy died from drugs. I did go to a meeting that night, my mother insisted I go eventhough I knew it wouldnt help and all I wanted to do was just go get numb and forget this ever happened. I always had it in the back of my head that eventually this disease was gonna kill him I just didnt expect it to be so soon. The saddest pasrt he died 3 days before our daughters birthday. kills me. I felt so guilty I didnt go see him and this and that, the what ifs and what could have been. It wasnt a week after he died I was right back on the street, living in hotels, and selling my body once again for another hit. Alot happens after but that was an event.

24,Looking back at my drinking…,kneecapbobs,"Was kinda curious what you guys think about this. I look back on my past behavioral patterns and poly-substance abuse. But in particular I noticed that alcohol was always a constant throughout all of my other heavy addictions (including cocaine, crack, crystal meth, nO2, lsd, pain killers, muscle relaxers, barbiturates. Might be missing a couple… keyboard cleaner air dusters, triple c’s) I haven’t had too difficult a time dropping each of these addictions once they had run their coarse in my life. Idk where I’m really going with this but recently I’m realizing just how fucked up I was ALL THE TIME! From the age of 13 to the age of 30 I don’t know that I ever had a truly sober moment or even a sober thought, honestly. I guess my point is this: now in recovery, do any of you have these moments where I’m sitting here almost in disbelief considering the amount of drugs I’ve done and the amount of time I was under the influence of something…

I’m just happy to be alive and not be dependent on anything but love and happiness today! I hope this finds you all well and if nobody has told you today, you are doing great! I’m proud of any one of you who is working thru addictions and recovery! Keep up the hard work!! The light does exist on the other side. And if you don’t believe that, believe that I believe it until you can see it for yourself!!

25,finding friendship and intimacy in recovery,Intonated,"Hey there, first time posting here, I'm taking a chance today... the list of things I'm (39m) recovering from is long, here's the short version - a lifetime of anxiety, depression, ocd.. two decades of drug and alcohol addiction and eating disorders.. I lived on the street for a couple of years, flying a cardboard sign for booze money.. Spent time in dozens of inpatient treatment facilities, hospitals, halfway houses, and psych units for a variety of things.. Had a couple serious suicide attempts, a few drug induced psychotic episodes.. So yeah, life is hard, I know I'm not the first one to figure that out.. 

The first time I got serious about recovery, I fell in love with an incredible woman, also a recovering alcoholic, and she'd been diagnosed with chirrosis of the liver. I loved her so much, it felt so good being with her, I think I somehow thought that love would fix everything.. But as she got sicker, we both got scared and stressed, and we both relapsed. I didn't know what to do, so I did the thing I always did, I drank away the pain. After suffering a serious head injury from a fall that almost killed me, I went to treatment aaagain, but I still couldn't stop, I was out of control.. and my girlfriend didn't want me living with her anymore. I felt so much pain, and all I could do was drink. She died unexpectedly in the hospital a few weeks later, three days after my birthday. It was absolutely devastating. I would never get another chance to try to make things right. I've had time to grive, but I'm still trying to find a way to fully forgive myself, I wasn't there for her when she needed me. 

A lot has changed since then, things got worse before they got better, but I'm now solidly in recovery from it all. I haven't touched alcohol in five years, and got help for my eating disorder two years ago. I worked hard to get here and learned I am stronger than I ever knew. Life is manageable now, I can actually live with myself, I even enjoy being me sometimes. I take control of my therapy sessions now and I make them work for me, it's never been like this before. 

But there's a big piece missing, I'm painfully lonely. I got the sweetest cat last year, she is the light of my life, but she doesn't make great conversation... My anxiety makes it ridiculously hard to make friends as it is, then a few years ago I developed a physical disability that keeps me stuck at home, most of the time in pain. My biggest passion in life is playing and performing music, but I can't do that nearly as much as I'd like to these days. That was also my best way of meeting people. So I finally made this reddit account recently, hoping maybe I'd find a community somewhere, but also knowing reddit isn't the safest place for an emotionally sensitive person to go looking for support and friendship... I gotta start somewhere, right? I'm not going to meet anyone if I keep to myself.. 

I've been feeling an intense craving for the intimacy of a romantic relationship... I feel like I have so much love to give.. But that seems laughably impossible these days. I'm in recovery, but my mind is complicated, and my body is broken.. I carry so much baggage... I've made so many mistakes, hurt so many people.. Sometimes I think this is what I must deserve, and I should just be grateful I'm still alive. I should focus my energy on building a safe, comfortable, private life for myself, I can control that... But then I get sad again. 

Today my loneliness motivated me to write this post.. But my anxiety and ego will probably convince me it's stupid, I used too many unnecessary words, tried way too hard, and just because I feel like I have a lot to say doesn't mean anyone wants to hear it. It's so much easier being alone..sometimes... 

I'm not looking for some miracle answer, I'm not trying to ""solve"" my loneliness right now, just kinda flirting with the idea of maybe someday being less lonely, taking small steps to put myself out there without expectations.. 

If by some chance anyone did read this, any thoughts? Doesn't have to be super helpful or anything, I just want to get out of my own thought pattern..",5,4,0.06071499772157666

28,"Anticipatory Anxiety and ""Triggers""",DANCING_PHILOSOPHER,"*“Always do what you are afraid to do.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson*

In this **polemic essay**, and a few following ones—for the topic I want to convey, the message to be delivered and hopefully property understood, are quite complex—I want to point at this valuable thought of a heavyweight psychologist Viktor Frankl. For context, he is a founder of Logotherapy and perhaps rightfully can be called the fourth giant of psychology. This to say, that the following thoughts **are not just my own speculation**, nor of a domesticated psychologist. Briefly, Logotherapy is a psychological approach founded upon the assumption that **meaningless life** is the source of our **psychological problems**. It is the **lack of meaning** in our lives, especially in the first world countries, where all fundamental needs are satisfied, that causes all sorts of uncertainties, disorders, depression, anxiety, and in my belief **even alcoholism** (at least for me).

**Anticipatory anxiety** is a term in Logotherapy that defines our **fear** of an event in the future that causes the **anxiety**. *It is a characteristic of the fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid. In other words, what we fear is exactly how we make the event to be perceived by us. In this context, one might amend the saying “The wish is father to the thought” to “The fear is mother to the event.”* 

With the problem of “**triggers,”** it is how I see that when I am **afraid of relapse** that is precisely what I will do at any suitable moment. It is the **fear of relapse** that makes me use any problematic situation in life to turn it into a **cause for relapse**. Thoughts that I must avoid conflicts, family parties, alcohol shelves in a grocery store, and—**God! What a cruelty!**—relationship in my first year of sobriety, reduce all sorts of distraction, etc. because they may lead me to relapse is the anticipatory anxiety, an already **pre-made decision**, plan, and even a **solution to drink if such and such**.   

Very similar thoughts can be found in Alfred Adler’s psychology, the third giant of psychology. Freud once famously said: “There is only one psychologist among us, it is Alfred.” The foundation of all our actions and even feelings is the decision, perhaps subconscious decision which we didn’t make one day, we “resolved” into having such a decision; and we look for **any handy cause** and situation to implement it. 

On a broader scale, **“hyper-intention”** not to drink is precisely, and paradoxically, **what makes me drink**. Narrowing the focus of my attention to this one obsession, and zoning out of life, seeing life through the perspective of drinking problems, making all my decisions to be **whittled down by alcoholism** \- in short, **putting “sobriety first”** is what makes me drink.

*“Logotherapy bases its technique called “paradoxical intention” on the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes.” – Viktor Frankl*

What I wish, is a normal life. Do I really want and need it? Well, meaning is enough. If I get it - I get it; if not - I can say a dedicated, decent, able man put everything he could into his life, he found his meaning. **Life was not a waste!**

Learn the lesson and keep moving on, apologize when I make a mistake, try new things, ask myself hard questions and try to answer them. 


I will continue to challenge past experiences to give myself a chance at new ones.


The longer I'm sober the more I realize I'm only here once, that sobriety has granted me the gift of accepting change, being change, and not fighting it. 


I've learned I need a lot less to survive, things really don't mean much. Developing relationships, nurturing them, and working on being a good person, father, and friend is way more fulfilling than any box delivered by amazon. 


It's the people, it's you.


Tell yourself you're worth it, that you're valuable, that you're special. 


It's because you are! 


Together WE can do this, 640 one day at a times. ❤

37,Helping my roommate?,wolffepacks,"(I posted this in another subreddit because I really need help.)

A few months ago my dear friend had their housing fallout. They came to live with me and we haven’t had any issues. When they came to live with me they were still underage and I was listed as their guardian. They’re legal now but in extended foster care.

Recently they’ve been acting abnormal, their sleep schedule is fucked (sleeps from 7am-5pm, stays up all night) after spending weeks on end w their bf, he brings them around his cousin who’s a bigger meth dealer and allows ppl to use in front of them. They turn their live location on and off, come in and out of contact, and only wants to come home for 24hrs to two nights at a time. This morning at 5am they sent me a video where they looked like they were tweaking, 24hrs after their bf picked them up (at 5am in the meth dealers car btw). 

I love them so dearly, they’re truly family to me. Ik if they’ve relapsed they won’t admit it, and I don’t want to start pointing fingers and stuff. 

Someone recommended I reach out to their caseworkers but I want to do it anonymously? Ik if they’re using they’ll hate me if they know I did it, and if they’re not using it’ll hurt so deeply. I don’t know what to do, or how to help. Im concerned and I don’t want this to come off as hateful - but if they’re using I have to evict them. They’re subletting technically, but I rent from my grandparents and don’t want to involve my grandparents in this.

39,6+ months off coke,No_Flow_9855,"Thanksgiving was 6 months from the last time I did coke. 
I tried coke for the first time 20 years ago. I did it any chance I had since then. I lived in Syracuse from 2009-2011. I worked at a popular restaurant and got really into coke. Five nights a week partying and drinking. I was 23-25. Lightened up a bit. Then I found the dark net in 2014. Started ordering online. Found local dealers and went really hard as a bartender until May 2022. 
I still smoke weed and drink (a lot) but don’t have the urge to do coke. I was going to group every week but it got cancelled because of Covid. 
I have heard that it’s “impossible” as a cocaine addict to abstain from coke when you still drink. 
What’s the consensus on using certain substances while abstaining from others?",8,2,0.015595238095238103
40,"""Evil"" Sobriety",DANCING_PHILOSOPHER,"*“And he who must be a creator of good and evil: truly, he must first be a destroyer and break values” – Friedrich Nietzsche*

First, what “evil” means in this context. It is demolishing or destroying–which is an evil act–the foundations, to build something new on the clean surface. Partying with my past and the ugly image of my past self. It is also, though, breaking the “be yourself” rhetoric.

As Freud teaches us–*suppressed emotions never die, they will come out in uglier ways* (most probably when I am drunk)–holding in our opinions, our thoughts (which are shadows of our emotions) **is not a sustainable strategy**. What I want to add is that adjusting them to the norms might have a similar outcome as well.

One day, in my 20s, I turned myself from being quite boring into being very disgusting. It was the birthday party of a girl who I really liked and wanted to make an impression on her. Normally, when sober, I am not very talkative about every day hustles, especially in groups. But, as many of us, I know the life hack: drink! So I did, did it thoroughly and diligently, as I do everything, with style. But as I also do everything, it was with uncontrollable passion and eventually I turned into an unbearable and disgusting person as I vomited everywhere. So most certainly I made an impression, the goal was achieved. Referring to Freud, it is easy to see that this is the result of **repressing or replacing** what *is* in my mind with what it *should be* in your mind.

Needless to say that my case is not so uncommon, **I drank to tune my thoughts to fit the society standards**: to become talkative, funnier, interesting – to satisfy the demands, in short.

The other case was the opposite. In my other relationship, I didn’t drink to make it happen and I didn’t drink during the journey. There were no signs of dissatisfaction or unhappiness on her side, or what I thought. In any case, no problem arose and nothing was pointed to in an attempt to fix it. Not even a slightest hint that something is not right. But she cheated on me. The hurtful breakup resolved into a turmoil of drinking for me.

So, in these two cases **I drank to adjust myself** to the norms–which didn’t work–and **I didn’t drink in an attempt to “be myself”**–which resulted in a laughable mistake and misery. And these are just two cases, there is no shortage of such examples in my life even besides relationships.

*Vladimir Pozner: “When you die and meet God, what will you tell Him?”*  
*Yuval Noah Harary: “You could do better.”*

This is something that has always fascinated me: how so an element of a system cannot fit into the system? How is society always repressive towards an individual? A mind cracking paradox… **Inability to incorporate into society,** in a very broad sense including jobs, goals, meanings, wishes, lifestyle is **perhaps the strongest reason** for many folks to drink. It is hard to admit for me that **alcoholism is a problem in itself**. **Most definitely it doesn’t arise out of desire to drink.** How horrible it is to realize that you don’t fit the standards…

So, the “evil” thinking here for me is the **furious demolition** of the burden that I don’t fit into the society. It is, for sure, partying with a part of myself. With one very non useful part: **greed!**; a mistaken belief that **life has to give me something back** for my investments, for my “expected” behavior; that everything is punishable or rewardable, everybody is accountable, expectation of something–preferably desirable–in return for my actions. It’s not that I am doing it to finally find my place in life, it is more that I don’t let my ruined hopes lead me to drinking.  

*“Do you want to have an easy life? Then always stay with the herd and lose yourself in the herd” – Friedrich Nietzsche*

**“Evil” sobriety** taught me two invaluable lessons: one is about faith and the other is about acceptance. What can be said in one sentence\*\*: have faith, be courageous enough to act and accept any outcome.\*\* It decomposes the obfuscated statements above into **faith to act** and **courage to be disliked**. Since we live in society, one will never be oneself anyway.

42,my stepmom is a crackhead,Heavy_Goal_8698,"I wanna tell you a story about my stepmother.

Backstory..So my dad met lets call her tina and boy did he fall in love and it wasnt long before they were living together. Tina has had some injuries in the past so gets some pills perscribed to her right well she liked those pills a little too much and when my dad realized it was a problem it was to late. he already fallen in love with her. She had some good things about her but to me she was kinda cold. I moved in with them when I was pregnant with my 2nd child and my dad and tina adored my first born so it was ment to be. Not only did I move in with them my boyfriend at the time who was the father of my child moved in with us he was at the time addicted to herion. (I am not talking about him)

Tina was great but she could be lazt and didnt treat my dad very good, she didnt work and sat at home. when she ran out of pills she had my dad go get her more. I dont think my dad realized how much of an addict she was and her behavior just got worse. My dad loved her and he was most of the time happy and when I decided they were getting married some odd days after I gave birth to my second child rubbed me the wrong way and I kind of got angry about it but I quickly realized this is my dads life and his choice on to who he wants to be with forever right? so i went to the wedding and i became happy for them. She was actually an RN and because she was hurting she stopped working for the first few years they were together but she was made to geta job. Dad lost his job and when she was looking she realized she could make over $20 and hour. She worked and not long after she got her first check dad got a job and started banking well they stupidly rented this huge house and it was like one of those dream homes and they were living big until the day my dad came home early from work one day and caught her smoking crack in the master bathroom jacuzzi tub. He told me he told her right there they were gonna loose everything and they sure did. She got into it real bad um she would be gone for days or come home at 4am take a shower tell us she has no money and go get dope, she had female boss dealers over and Im fuckin 8 months pregnant I know now thos females carry guns. Tina sold my dads car for dope, stole his safe with cash and his original birth certfifcate i mean this woman she fuckin fell and my dad didnt realize how hard it was to be with an addict. I said in one of my other stories 2 of my kids father was a herion addict, I kept it secret for the first year but it was hard even when I had to tell who was in fact Tina. He went to rehab and I told Tina about everything he had been doing. he stole everything from me lied to me and 100% cheated on me with the needle after he promised he would never. Yea never believe that. Anyway Tina was on the downward spiral and I remember when I told dad ""better be careful next thing u know ur gonna come home and the tv is gonna be gone."" he was like ""no she would never"" yea like not even a month later tv pawned computer sold her wedding rings and eventually stole my car. I mention I am a recoving crack/menth addicrt but all of this was before that, I had 2 jobs, took care of 3 small babies, my kids father was an herion addict, my dad was a full blown alcoholic, and there was my step mother who was now a crack head. I pressed charges and since Tina babysat while I worked she refused to babysit and i lost my job. I eventually moved out.

She continued to smoke for about year and then went to a nice rehab in california. I was living with my dad when she got out and came to live with us. I was clean at that time and scared to death, we had never done it together before but I was still terrified she could trigger me or relapse. It wasnt her fault I eventually relapsed I went to jail and shit and I was living on the street maybe a year later ythe first time I smoked with her. She was hanging out at my bestfriends house where our dope boy sits, she was playing connect four with him. I was there to stay too I got high with her showed her so moves whatever and it wasnt good from then on. I stayed with my dad in intravals like id be out for days and couldnt go home at 1am like i had a car but I was on the street alot and rested at dads. I was sleeping I had just had a 4 or 5 day straight run, no food, sleep, just dope. She knocked on the door and told me that my mother was dropping off the kids and said that if I answered the door I could stay for the weekend. I was notallowed at the time to be there when the kids were there because of where i was in life I would literally have to find somewhere to go on the weekends. Anyway, she also said if u answer u can stay and u can come hit this. She relapsed and took me down with her.. I wanted to stay to be with the kids but when they went to sleep I left.

Tina was a very sweet person but hated me and i felt the same about her we have even fist fought once so our history was rough but when she would smoke crack all that hate in her heart would dissappear and the kindest most amazing person came out. I even used that to my advantage at one point. But Tina stuggles to get and stay clean my dad stayed and left came back left again and I dont know he was there for her and he did his best to support her and it was hard for them at times but Tina was an addict and everything she ever did was for the same reasons I did. We knew the same people like say im clean and in soberliving and i called my dad asking how everything is and I am not sure what felt wrong about the whole conversation. He said Tina was on the couch sleeping which was no suprise I just didnt believe him. So when I hung up I called me and Tina mutal friend and asked if he saw her and dont u know it she was there dad lied and i get now why he did it but I hated that she was lying. Me and Tina had also spent some nights getting high and selling shit or hanging in hotels with guys or whatever but we were getting high she had money and I had a place for her to go and easy access to it. I dont know how to explain the shush shush when it came to crack, I just didnt understand why she slept with mike(hes in my curse story) she broke my heart like he and i was bonnie and clyde for 2 years and she knew this. tell me why a dope boy called my phone and told me he just sold her dope and mike was in the hotel room with her. so yea. I know it was the addiction I can never be mad at her for doing anything she did whatever.

So here we are Tina has been clean for 3 years as far as I know. She has a good job and her and my dad just moved into a beautiful rental. If you would have asked me a year ago how I felt about Tina I would have told you I fuckin hated her with every being in my body. I felt so much resentment and anger torwards her. I couldnt even hear her voice. I know how selfish but my God I hated her. I can tell you that she caused alot of shit and i paid for it. I felt she had no right to take my dad away, he was kicking me out eventhough he knew I had nowhere else to go but a dope boys house and he literally gave me money and still kicked me out because Tina wanted me out. I just wanted to get clean I was 4 days at that time. I spent alot of time thinking about how she betrayed me and how horrible she was and for some reason I felt that way for a long time. But I realized I had lost enough time hating other people when I had such a big part to play in to why I fuckin hate them. I healed and I wrote and thought about if it was even right for me to feel that way. It took some time but I can say I feel a mutual way about tina I hope the best for her. I will no longer just assume shes using and loosing jobs because of using. Her and my dad have my kids often and she has come to term with me being clean so she allows them to video me she has also welcomed me to visit and we have both said sorry and forgiven eachother. I never knew what forgiving someone felt like till Tina.",2,2,0.05369485452818784

55,Embracement against Acceptance,DANCING_PHILOSOPHER,"*“The redeem what is past, and to transform every “Is was” into “Thus would I have it!” – that only do I call redemption!” – Friedrich Nietzsche.*

In recovery there are just a few words as popular as **“self-acceptance”**. Every time I hear it, I hear echoes of **negative connotations**. This ball and chain of your “flaws,” “wrongdoings,” “regrets”—**that is what acceptance is to me**. Acceptance is a forced decision caused by fatalism, inability, inevitability, weakness. Salvation for the powerless herd to redeem them from the pain of **enduring their lives**.  

Thanks for reading Will to Live! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

In the realm of philosophy and psychology, and perhaps in human consciousness in general, in the “non-real” world, dualism is unavoidable. All the better for us, “evil” thinkers! 

*“It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.” – Epictetus.*

The matter at stake is not reality, nor its denial, nor its acceptance; the question is about subjectivity and personality, about our reaction to life events, to our actions, to interpretation of our decisions.

Acceptance makes me think hard for not seeing it as **succumbing**, as bending my knees in the face of my “regrets”. I send embracement to fight this poisonous thought. For **embracement is rising my head in the face of my past**, my demons, my innate dark side. **Self-embracement is the “self-acceptance” a willful man needs.**

Acceptance is a **forced act**, embracement is a **willful act**. You ask me what is the difference if the result is the same? The difference is the only one an able man need: **embracement keeps him in charge**. It holds him accountable before himself, and responsible for his loved ones, for his kids, for his mission, for his goal. Having that, the result will not always be the same. And even if it is the same, how do you want to live your life? Crawling on your knees or walking straight? 

It is not I who slip into a tight spot between my past and my regrets, it is I who opens the door into my spacious room for my past. I have lost a lot because of my alcoholism, I have regretted a lot about it and the only thing it gave me is **thinking less of myself**.  

*“All “It was” is a fragment, a riddle, a fearful chance – until the creating Will said thereto: “Thus would I have it!” – Friedrich Nietzsche.*

What I understand well is that **there are no “wrong” decisions**. Every decision I took, for any particular situation, was the right one. If we take into account our age, our life experience, the times we were in, our surroundings, our emotional conditions, our goals in the past, our desires back then—it becomes clear that what we did was the only reasonable option to do. It is the height of absurdity to criticize ourselves for that in a desperate attempt to **improve ourselves or our future**. And needless to say, it is the bottom of naivety, the attempt to fix the present utilizing regrets. A profound mistake to review those situations from our current life experience!

In regard to your own problems you are guilty of nothing. And thus, you have nothing to complain about, you have no regrets because “Thus would I have it!”. **That is redemption!**

A strong man, master of his own life, lord of his fate, does not “accept” himself, his shortcomings, “as he is”—he embraces himself, his personality; for he *“knows how to forget,”* he knows how to forgive. **Embracement is a privilege for kings!**

56,A little about me hope you like it,Heavy_Goal_8698,"Sorry its long.

My name is Kayla, I am 31 years old and I am from dayton ohio. I now live in buffalo new york. I have used all kinds of drugs throughout my life, I loved to experiment and figure out what felt the best. I remember consistantly looking for love, something to fill the emptyness i couldnt shake no matter what I did or who i gave myself to. I remember trying to numb all the feelings i had and block anything or anyone that could hurt me. I started with weed first, I didnt even get high the first time I smoked. I was having a sleep over at my dads house with a few girls i knew from school. One of the girls was a grade older and a little more experienced. After school the 3 of us went to the older girls house and she stole weed from her brother. I didnt really feel anything till the second time I smoked it. I never felt anything more amazing, I loved it. I was 11. My father was a hard drinker and so was his brother who eventually died from alchol, so growing up I watched all these grown ass men drink and act stupid and abusive so I never really got into drinking much. I did steal my dads liquor once or twice, ya know the old trick fill it with water and out it back into the freezer. Until one time it froze and i remember my dad laughing about it. Dad was a free spirit, he was more of a friend to me growing up then a parent. I guess he was just afraid that I would hate him so he just let me do whatever I wanted which become a problem into my teenage years. I definatly was aware of the addiction in my family but it never crossed my mind when I found myself crying pain to go to the hospital to get delodid or morphine.

I changed my life around when I was about 16. I decided to finish school eventhough I had a baby junior year.(ask me if you want to hear more) I went to a vocational school after high school and got certified to be a home health aid. At 18 I met a guy who was into cocain and pills. It was my first time doing it but my god i loved it. It was what i was looking for and I did it as much as i could the only problem with it was it made me sicker than a dog. I swear it was like my body was rejecting it. I tried oxycodone when I was 19. IT was even better than anything I had done before. I knew it was a one time thing because me and the guy I had been seeing spend the weekends snorting pills (xanax, vicoden, oxy, all kinds off pills) and drinking and having the best sex. We even recorded it, we would get high together and forget all our problems and just make love all night. Until I realized that he wasnt ok. He would get drunk and so angry and abusive.

I am not talking about him yet.. he and I actually had 2 kids together but he got addicted to herion when i was pregnant with our first child i loved him and thought he would get better, I tried to be there for him and I kept it to myself for years. I tried to be there for him and support him till one day I couldnt anymore, so this is hard subject.he introduced me to crack and then died from a herion overdose. if you want to know more because you stuggle with addiction or you lost someone you loved you are more than welcome and I will talk to you privatly but I cannot tell the story yet.

Ok, so fast forward.... >>>> Im now 24, 2015. I have my own 4 bed room house. I am taking care of myself and my 3 kids by myself (which is another story, I lost work and stuff happend to where I had to put aside morals to survive and feed my family. If you have questions ask.) I have been living without the guy for a few years while hes off going to rehabs and sober living but one day he came over and we just fell in love all over again. After about 2 years being kinda apart, I wanted him to be better. I moved him inand everything was going great till the day I decided to say outloud ""hey lets try crack.""

(a little context. my stepmother was a crackhead at the time and putting my dad through hell so I have no idea what was going through my head.)

Immediatly he came back and replied "" I know where to get it!"" like wow now I see it clear he had been doing it and it makes me angry he let me loose control. Like I lost everything within a couple months. Ok heres how it went. I tried it one day and not even a week later we have a girl whos homeless 100% crackhead living with us, (I hate saying this to other people because I am still so ashamed so whatever I am about to write it was the drugs I would have never done any of that in my right mind) the kids were going hungry because I was selling all my food stamps, HE sold his car for dope, I lost the kids to my mom, it was supposed to be temporary but... I fuckin made him get the fuck out of my house and sadly I met someone who taught me how to live the streets all while resorting to selling myself for drug money. I lost my house and then spent the next 4 or 5 years going through rehabs spending my time with worthless men and doing unimaginable things for drugs. I Lost everything I ever loved and everything I owned. Actually over and over again making the same mistakes and failing over and over again. I was homeless and slept in abandond houses. I remember one day seeing how bad the girl was living in my house eating my food sucking dick for $20 and whatever it took she was dirty and nasty I said to my guy please dont ever let me be like her and there i was carrying everything I owned on my back with nowhere to go getting raped and even kidnapped at one point because it was just the life I lived I smoked crack did herion occasionally and turned to meth. I never used a needle thank god and if I didnt meet Mark when I did I would be dead. The last time I used any of that was June of 2019. In am almost 4 years clean. we started our own buisness have 2 veichles and am finally happy and healthy, I talk to 2 out of 3 of my kids almost everyday. I have rebuilt some relationships and some are still rocky. this is a long hard road but I have many many stories and I would love to tell them all.

57,I rewrite the Grinch based off my experience in society.,FortheuserTronisreal,"In the story he exiles himself. Supposedly had a nerve disorder. Also just different. Lookin. So the Grinch began to think Xmas was all about money being an accountant. Counting numbers with a nerve disorder. Stressed all the way the f out. And all these who’s which are who’s so they could be anyone most likely society. They’re all sitting back and jolly about Xmas. I’m over here counting beans and freaking the f out. Go into the mountains hateful and pissed steal Xmas. Go back. And then we’re all holding hands. And I’d be standing there thinking. “You guys are assholes, but I need some friends.” Heart grows three times bigger and 3 days later they find me the Grinch grasping some presents dead from heart failure due to the heart thing.

59,Video games really have helped my recovery.,FortheuserTronisreal,"I figure I’ll write one thing on recovery everyday. I’ve always liked video games ever since I was a kid. You imagine streamers and people having lots of fun mostly. But for me it’s this journey through stories and music not to mention the challenge. I love getting wiped. That’s rare. I’ve seen some of the best jokes, dumbest stories and coolest stories have learned lots of new words and know lots of soundtracks. The reason I suggest games is because you’ll learn. Some even throw you into a role. Video games are easily obtained. Pointless but also a conversation piece of you choose. I figure if you want to broaden your horizons the simple keys are music, movies and video games. I take alot of time to reflect so books take me forever. If I actually read it’d only be applicable in jail. I need something I can start and stop on the fly. The reason I find these things useful is let’s say I see a movie. Well now I’m reminded of this years fashion. It’s sounds funny but think. I used to have a buddy when I lived at this homeless shelter. Two sinks and we’d shave. He always asked if I killed anyone yet. Because dude believed if you did some shit look fresh. 😂 there’s better reasons to up your game but I agree. Better look good if you’re going out for business. I’ve been exposed to more Latin through video games than I’ve ever seen in life. I think self improvement some of its temporary but some things you’ll never forget. That’s why being thrown into a role or character can be memorable. Not to mention video games are a solo art. So it keeps you out of harms way.",3,0,0.24702581369248033
60,Watch out for these types of people.,Mindless-Apartment-0,"I wanted to share a story of how i was ripped off by a so called friend. He was 17 and i was 14. He knew that i was a curious kid that wanted to experiment with all types of drugs. So, i got a text from him. He asked me if i wanted to buy some pills from him that he had some. Me, as a stupid, naive little kid agreed and met him. Instead of pills he showed up with a little bag of white powder and said that it was meth. I was so shocked but also happy because i have never seen something like that at the time. So i gave him about  30 dollars. He said that he basically gifted it for me because it was really ''cheap''. And i trusted him because again. I was just a kid trying to look cool and was interested in things i was not supossed to. After a while he and his female friend basically ripped me off many times. Sometimes they gave me real pills, weed but fake powders and things like that. I told him that i didn’t want to buy drugs no more, but he told me he already ""got"" it and that i had to because then i would ripped HIM off. And i listened to him because i was scared little shit, and i didn’t want to destroy my ""friendship"". I had to took money from my mom beacuse he would force me.  *(In total about 270 dollars and gave him about 40 dollars each)* This went on about a month. I know i was so stupid and so naive. I once paid pizza, so food for him. I once bought alcohol for him which i didn't even try because i had to go home. *(Total about 20 dollars)* Now, let me tell u how it ended. I told him that i didn’t care no more. I didn’t want to buy nothing from him. And guess what. After few manipulative words, he stopped. It felt good and i was finally free. I felt like my energy was draining from him. It felt like i was wasting my mom’s money and my time from one guy that didn’t had a job and a future. After weeks i didn’t think much of it. I just lived a normal life like nothing happed. But after about 6 months the feeling of anger, shame, grief, regret and frustration awaken. And i don’t know why now. I wake up with feeling of regret and anger everyday. Right now im recovering from that. I texted him and told him that he needs to think about his behaviour. Told him that he uses people for money and stuff like that. He told that i should not speak to him like that because his older than me. Then he started talking things about how i used to miss my ex which is another story. He basically started taking stuff from the past and talked about how i wanted the ""stuff"" from him even tho i clearly didn't. It then ended up with me saying i need to go study. Yeah i'm trying to focus on my future unlike him. This roma or gypsy guy is pretty popular in our town. Everybody knows him and likes him. Only clowns tho, woke people hate that son of a bitch. He is very manipulative and charismatic. He wears expensive clothes because thats all he can do with the money. He doesnt have a job and doesnt even show up in school. He told me he ripped off many people. Which is stupid because it literally ruins his reputation as a dealer but whatever. I blocked him everywhere and cutted off all the poeple that liked him. Now back to me. I am currently working on making money and i have a plan. I will gift most of the money to my mom because she deserves it. (She doesnt know about me taking the money) We were not damaged financially at all. We are not that poor but i just feel damn sick for what i did. So yeah i will give most of my money to my mom. As i said i constantly have that feeling of stupidity and regret. And i dont know how to get rid of it. Im working on it tho. Thats the end of the story  i guess. So im warning u guys, stay away from these types of people.",4,2,-0.05207341269841271

63,Meetings,Previous_Basis8862,"So I have been looking into and reading Recovery Dharma literature and I quite like it. I went to my first online meeting yesterday though and really didn’t like it - it just didn’t gel with me at all, which surprised me. I am going to try another meeting as perhaps it was just that one meeting. 

On the other hand, I thought I would hate AA but have found I quite enjoy AA meetings. There are some aspects of AA I’m not a fan of (like the term “alcoholic” and introducing myself as one. I fully accept I have an Alcohol Use Disorder and am what AA considers an “alcoholic” but I just find that term a little old fashioned and with so many negative connotations) but I gather many people have bits and pieces of the programme they don’t necessarily like but it works anyway. Anyway, this is just semantics and won’t stop me going back. 

I’m going to try a SMART recovery meeting today to see how that goes. 

I’m just trying to find the right fit for me and my recovery and am keeping an open mind. I am also very grateful that there are so many online options these days.

I’ve just realised there is no real point to my post but if anyone has any recommendations or advice, feel free to share!",5,4,0.09293478260869566
64,"Some days I love that I’m an addict, some days I hate it.",Recovery4Kate,"There are days where I feel like I love my journey, it belongs to me, it’s who I am, it’s who I’ve been. I love the places I’ve been, the things I’ve seen, however horrendous or extravagant they may have been.  

Today, to be blunt, I fucking hate that I feel as if I’ve now felt the most amazing feeling that a human being could succumb to. That artificial euphoria that streams from the crook of my elbow to my heart, the rush of the heat to my head, my hands, my feet…the throbbing ecstasy. 

It’s crazy how in meetings I find myself staring at my veins, seeing how pronounced they are, how fucking juicy they are, how surely, I would never miss. Straight into the bloodstream. Just to forget anything and to feel every molecule of pleasure immediately surge through my body. 

And then I noticed where my mind has gone,  I come back to reality. I look around to see if anyone in the rooms has noticed how intensely I am investigating and smoothing my fingers over my healthy veins. 

I tune in to the person talking, I think of the addict still suffering – being prayed for. I hope someone is praying for me, praying for you. I’m praying for you. 

I tear my sleeves back down to cover my arms, I sit on my hands, I beg to God, to the rooms as my higher power, to anything to take this obsession away from me. 

Back to reality outside of my own mind I listen to the similarities. It is the easiest, most relatable and effortless love I’ve ever had to give or receive- here in these rooms. 

This is my home and it is where I’ve always belonged. Thank you for loving me until I can love myself, thank you for telling me to ‘keep coming back’, thank you for not pushing me away, thank you for understanding, relating, including and allowing myself to be who I am and to grow into who I want to be. I love you.",8,8,0.16132478632478633

72,Addiction is a lot different than most things.,FortheuserTronisreal,It’s just a short thought but I look back and can’t exactly describe why as to why I was in addiction. Other than I had an addiction. Most things in life we can describe. Even if it’s simply being hungry so you made food or stole food. There’s no real legitimate reason or is there one reason if a list of reasons can be made. It’s super tricky. I find reasons. But addiction quite literally is a subject of its own which can’t be described or exactly cured. As there is no real reason other than simply being addicted.,4,11,0.06111111111111111

75,What You didn't Know about Emotions,DANCING_PHILOSOPHER,"*“Unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways.” – Sigmund Freud*

I am quite skeptical about all the widely known techniques for “controlling” your emotions like “proper” breathing, meditations, de-escalation, rescheduling an argument for a better time, mindfulness, etc. Everything that looks not too different from **succumbing** and **kneeling**.

I am making a high bet that you didn’t know about the original, and for me very accurate, perspective on emotions of Alfred Adler: e**motions are just another tool for communication**. It is a **means to achieve your goal** in interpersonal interaction. When we are stuck in a gridlock situation of exchanging reasons we utilize certain emotions to get to another level of convincing the others, i.e. **achieving our goals**.

I believe we all have been in a situation when we speak with one person feeling anger, and when another person interrupts, in an instant we speak to that person experiencing completely different or even opposite emotions. Imagine you are vigorously arguing with one friend, **overflown by a sense of anger**, and when another one, towards whom you feel nothing but joy or gratitude, at that very moment says something like “Is everything OK? Can I help somehow?” our immediate response will be like “Yeah, we good, sorry. I will handle it.” Our very deep feeling immediately becomes at least neutral, at most **opposite to anger**. This is undeniable proof that we can **fabricate our emotions** as we please, in an instant, depending on the goal of communication.

Knowing that, it would be wise to ask yourself what goal you are trying to achieve in any particular situation where you feel emotions are coming. It will by far make you a **master of your emotions**. Every single Stoic alive, the Stoicism itself, will ask you for advice to adjust their philosophy.

**Emotion is anticipation of the result**. When we forecast a situation into the outcome that is dangerous, we experience fear; when the situation is expected to resolve into an unfair, unjust for us result, our loss, we experience anger and demand for justice speaks from us. Even such an emotion like disgust, which doesn’t always even need the other side of communication, is progressing into **us seeing ourselves that much adverse**. In other words - result.

In the very same way we use **so-called “triggers”** as an excuse to drink. We f**abricate negative emotions** to give us an additional reason to drink. When we are crushed, when we experience a loss, we r**ebel against its cause**, we cultivate the sense of revenge, unfairness, resentment to others or ourselves; in short - **low vitality**. We devalue the object of loss by telling ourselves something like “Burn in hell! My defeat means nothing to me, it has zero value. I am going to drink then!” Since I have experienced pain, I am going to either hurt you back or amplify the feeling of pain for myself by drinking.

In summary, what I didn’t know is that **emotions are made from clay**. Remembering that they are **nothing but a means to achieve your goals**, helps me greatly to control them. Since I am doomed to deal with them, one way to do so is to always ask myself **what result I am trying to achieve**. And the best way to do so is to distantiate myself from the result. Adlerian psychology gives us a very practical tool: **Separation of Tasks**. In short, we have to separate what we do and how it will be received by others. **My task** is always to do my best! Always work hard, put two hundred percent of me into what is meaningful to me and don’t bother myself how others will accept that result. **It is their task.**

Religious people, believers, spirituals, High Power worshipers, etc. have an indisputable advantage in that regard. For you, my friends, know what others don’t: **faith is not a belief in unproven, it is courage to act regardless of the outcome.** 

*“He believes neither in “ill-luck” nor “guilt”; he can digest himself and others; he knows how to forget–he is strong enough to make everything turn into his own advantage” – Friedrich Nietzsche.*

And thus, and lastly, uncontrolled emotions can **lead to unmanageable outcomes**. Our weakness in front of such an outcome is the sole reason we control them. But what does a strong man think about “unbearable” outcomes? **He doesn’t give a damn! He can deal with everything, he is made from meat!**

79,I’m the same way about death as love.,FortheuserTronisreal,I’m actually pretty well off with how people die. It’s just the way it is. I had an ex that passed away about 10 years ago and my parents before that. And I sit here and it’s almost the same as I treat relationships. I been through it so the worst is over. I don’t believe in an afterlife. I’m 50/50 on that. No doubt about god. Even if god is just some important rule that makes things work. I think no afterlife is a good way to look at it. Because today I have to make the best of it. These days are limited. And if not atleast that’s a good way to see it. Things will always affect us but certainly not as much as when we’ve never been through it. My mom passed away around this time last year but there’s something about moms. Can’t really be sad when someone lived a good life and you’re grateful towards them. So maybe that has a lot to do with it.,2,0,0.17321428571428568

88,Alcoholism is a Gift,DANCING_PHILOSOPHER,"*“The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep—into the evil.” – Friederich Nietzsche*

Going through a lot of pain, troubles, which we made for ourselves, being in the most intimate relationship with our flaws and shortcomings is t**he best way to know yourself**, to know how far you can go if you are truly free and don’t think about any consequences. The **monster you can turn into** when drunk is proof of that. Nietzsche quote about diametrical traits. So if I can go that far in **the dark side**, I can go further in **the bright side**: I can be a reliable, trustworthy, loving, caring, and decent man for myself and my siblings.  

Having lost tremendously a lot because of alcohol, I learned how to appreciate what I lost. **Love, happiness, meaning** these are all subtle things that we notice only when they are gone. When there is too much of it it just wears out and loses its effect on us. Same like oxygen: **we only notice, or even think about it, when there is no oxygen**. We think that the best offers of life are something we should take for granted.

**Alcoholism is vaccination against stupidity**. Having stepped into the same trap uncountless number of times I learned very well what to avoid in my life. Starting with high level matters like self-defeating thoughts, anxiety, pessimism, depression and ending with very practical matters like what not to say to your loved ones, what your promises mean to them, how my little losses can resolve into dramatical loses for people around me, and how I interact in a very broad sense.

*“The unexamined life is not worth living."" – Socrates*

It is hard to imagine a **better personality test** than alcoholism: once you see all your shortcomings, flaws, and weaknesses, you have a very clear idea of what your strengths are. The entire psychology sucks, and all psychologists in the world wish they could exercise such a test on their patients. This is what alcoholism to me: **it is the best imaginable tool for self-examination**. It is hard to think of a better solution than seeing yourself acting with absolute freedom of consequences.

Looking back in my past and what I have been through, all the problems that I creatively made by myself, I am amazed how I still have **Will to Live**. How I even have a sense of hope. But that is precisely what alcoholism revealed to me, however cliche-like it sounds: I still love life, I still remain positive, I still believe in myself, I still can make my loved ones happy, or at the very least I know that I will do what I can. Alcoholism revealed for me my best strength: my **Will to Live.**

*“Be careful when you cast out your demons that you don’t throw away the best of yourself.” – Friedrich Nietzsche*

**Alcoholism simplifies life**. Father of my girlfriend, a Vietnam veteran, once told me something that struck me deeply: **war is simple!** Life on the battlefield is simple. There, it is very clear what you must do and what must not. So does alcoholism, it simplifies life. **Alfred Adler** believes that too: **life is simple.** We just make it unnecessarily complex by overthinking, by problematizing it. It is so pitiful to see when people make them unhappy out of nothing, all by themselves, when others keep living, climbing, hoping, regardless of anything.

94,i’m trying my best,laylaa890,"healing is difficult when everyone close to you feels embarrassed by your mere existence. my mother refuses to tell people what i’m doing with my life when they ask because she doesn’t know what to say. it makes sense. her co-workers’ children have had normal lives. and telling them that i’m still in school, not in college at the age of 19 is going to be like social suicide for her. how could it be that your daughter dropped out and didn’t do anything for a year?? it doesn’t matter that i had severe ocd and psychotic depression and almost died. what matters the most to people who put appearances over pure concern for the people close to them is just that! superficiality. 

i haven’t had the shiniest, most traditional academic/career life path. it’s just beginning for me at the age of 19. and i’m very very fucking proud of myself. nobody really understands how it feels like to not have your shit together when everyone you’re surrounded by is going off to wherever for college and getting a degree or a job and you’re still trying to pass high school. 

what matters to me, though, is that i don’t think of dying every single day. i think of healing and take care of myself and my body and i learned to be okay with myself. i learned to love myself. i wish to be appreciated and loved for surviving but i know people still have a long way to go before they understand me and my life",5,2,0.14156641604010028
95,Tipps and apps to make my mind function better?,DuHueresohn,"Hey, so got sober and i really wanna move on to a new chapter of life. I did drugs on a daily base for about 2.5 years now. Im only 20 years old and i couldnt go to worn due to my mental health problems.

I literally got stupid and i hate myself for it, but i wanna start using my brain efficient instead of crying and complaining about it to regenerate my mind.

I know that being outside, sports and social contacts are really good to help the brain function again. I started going outside more and it really helps me with a good feeling. I also heard that the game „memory“ is good for the short time memory, im going to buy it tomorrow.

Sorry for my bad english btw, im from Switzerland and im not so good at other languages:)",2,1,0.0007034632034631823
96,Relapsed on meth after 5 years of recovery and I'm freaking out.,PoppySheep2,"Like the title says, I've (29f) been clean from meth and heroin for the better part of five years now. Tonight, I woke up to find that my SO (30m) wasn't home. When I called him he didn't answer, but walked in the door shortly thereafter and told me that he had ""picked something up"" before pulling a rock out of his pocket.

I don't even know why, I just... Did it. He's an active alcoholic, although he's been clean from hard drugs for the same time period as I have. He used being stressed about finals as an excuse but this obviously goes way deeper than that and, I'm sure it goes much deeper than that for me as well.

I'm scared. Terrified, really. Drugs took everything from me (I'm sure I don't need to get into the details, you all know what I mean) and I'm afraid that I'm going to have to jump back on the wagon alone. I can't do this again. He and I had to separate in order to get clean the first time and if he loses himself to this I know I'm going to have to walk away otherwise I will lose myself as well.

I guess I just need some advice, words of encouragement, or to just know I'm not alone. I've worked so hard for the life I have now and I feel like I've betrayed everybody who loves me. Please be kind.",60,21,0.07367424242424242
98,A year of recovery.,FortheuserTronisreal,"That’s what you want. I relapsed once. I say once because I was going and was trying and got more and more time mostly each time. Once. 2 weeks. Once like 90 days surround by the crap. But then I got away and got 9 months then I consider that a relapse. I say a year because your inventory and time spent after about a year adds up into good time and good stuff. A lot don’t want to hear about what you’ve earned but I’ll keep it simple. If I had gained anything in addiction. I used to just keep a tv and game system. Other than that it was gone. Up for trade. Now I got countless things laying around my apartment. Even stuff I don’t use. After you’ve sat in addiction any amount of time will seem short. Atleast for me and I’m not sure why I think that way yet. I express my opinion because I’ve heard a few over the years state they’re depressed about how sobriety isn’t being riches. It’s like man, a car for me. That’s a big deal to begin with. In no way do I need a vehicle. That’s a big responsibility. I’d say after a year things feel a lot better. About 2 in. Start to expect that car. If someone wasn’t coming off the sht and didn’t have to focus on their recovery you can expect a car in 6. As addicts we definitely fall behind in alot of different ways.",5,0,0.05624999999999998
99,Life feels like it wont get better and im about give up,DillyLova,"Im 45 days sober off of cocaine, opiates and alcohol now and life feels hopeless. I feel like i will never feel genuinely happy again. I dont even know if its worth it to get sober, I’ve already lost everything and ruined all my relationships. My life is such a mess and my health is terrible and im only 19. I know i can probably fix it but i dont know if i can do it at this point, i miss not caring about things. All day and all night im either mad or sad or anxious.

I feel like giving up everything and going back out, i hate the person i am and i always have, atleast using drugs made me feel like i fit in, nowadays i just feel like a scumbag who belongs on the streets but is too pussy to go. Ik im being overdramatic but I genuinely feel terrible and that i dont belong anywhere.",11,10,-0.140625

101,My psychotic break.,GoofyFoot76,"Very few people can say they are thankful for a psychotic break. But I am. I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for mine. My best friend thinks I obsess over my accident but I’m curious. It’s because so much is lost to me and I just need info. I don’t feel whole. All I briefly remember is hallucinating. Seeing everything but it all flashing in black and red and being disoriented. Then being in the hospital. Not bashing my head (I got a concussion). No ambulance ride. I also don’t remember a lot before it. Certainly not a lot after it. The mind is incredible. He also said I shouldn’t “Facebook” my info from Twitter and YouTube. Does he think I don’t take my health seriously? I read reputable sources and studies and talk to my doctor. I found out myself I had HIV encephalopathy and that it’s an acquired brain injury. What my future is going to look like due to this condition. Like I said, I just need info.     

A little more backstory: as aforementioned, I had a break and subsequent concussion. At the hospital I was diagnosed with pneumonia, encephalitis (thus my HIV encephalopathy) and I was HIV+. Spent a month in the ICU which I do not remember. But I got sober in there. I was well in my way to drinking myself to death. Seriously. I didn’t care. I wasn’t going to stop. The nurses told my best friend that I was close to death and they didn’t know how well I’d recover cognitively if I lived. All this was three years ago. So good did come of all this. I’m happier than I can remember.  I got a second chance and clean slate. So however you get, and stay, sober keep it up. Heads up, shoulders back fellow recoverers.",8,2,0.1197746598639456
102,Nightmares in early recovery,ElephantOk9697,"Almost one month. Cocaine and alcohol.

Tonight I had sleep paralysis and dreamed about members of AA meetings. Asked for help. They were spreading the message and left me alone.

I just left a korean church named Shincheonji,like 4 days ago. Could it connect?

Thanks God, no desire to drink or do drugs, just scared. It is almost midnight...",5,2,0.06666666666666667
103,Highly Sensitive Recvering Addict,Equal_Philosopher629,"I've been in recovery for 5 years. I'm a part of an amazing recovery community that has saved my life more than once. Unfortunately, as I have gotten better my relationship with my parents has changed. I went from depending on them a lot for emotional support (and every other kind of support) to now seeing them much less. They were part of my daily for 30 years and were advisors on every decision I made. I've since gotten married as well and they went through relationship issues of their own and both of my siblings have had children and my parents love being grandparents,  which I love dor them. They have always been my biggest cheerleaders. Sadly I feel us drifting. I don't live as close as I wish I did and my new job has me unable to visit as much. I've been over here growing up and creating a pretty amazing life w my husband. I literally went from living in a 200 sq ft room with no kitchen to living in a comfortable condo. I've established a business and started working a 2nd job in a field I love. I'm happy but that relationship is missing. They have also made comments that have really upset me. When I brought up possibly trying to have a baby with my husband (who I've been w for over 10 years) they said ""there's nothing wrong with being an Aunt"" that hurt. We've been looking to buy a house and they don't seem very interested or happy for us. (Im proud of us for saving for a house in such a short time) We eben keep a bank receipt on our fridge to remind of us of where we were on 12/07/2017 -2 months after getting clean. We had $125 in our bank account. I don't need a parade but a little encouragement from them would feel great. They don't call me just to check in like they used to. I know I'm an adult but I lost out on my entire 20s due to addiction and so now I'm missing them. They are very close with my siblings and I hate to admit that that hurts too. They actually get together a lot and have not invited me. I don't know if anyone could help but I've been kind of depressed bc of this. What do I do? My parents don't really feel comfortable talking but maybe it's time I try? I definitely don't want to feel sorry for myself but based on our previous relationship I just thought it would be different.",7,0,0.1400698158051099
104,Spirituality and reality.,FortheuserTronisreal,I’m not really sure how to start this paragraph so there you have it. Last night I kept seeing those dark figures out of the corner of my eye. My addiction taught me something I think is extremely important. Never should you entertain the shamanistic attitude. A lot of us can’t see those “ghost” or shadow people. Me I just figure I have an over active imagination. Because when I entertain the fact they’re real. I pursue them. Call it what you will. Real. Spiritual. Crazy. Hallucinations. It doesn’t really matter. I highly suggest you don’t pursue this path. It led me to some bad situations. We believe spiritual beings exist on a higher level. And oddly enough that idea matches up with the identity of drugs. When we amp ourselves up. The chemical reactions in our bodies move quicker or alternate into something else. So as human beings often times we project ourselves upon our reality. So if we feel eurphoric or are tripping we’re casting our higher selves out and therefore see glimpses of that higher thought. Drugs are important to a lot of cultures because of that. Drugs are basically the portal to this strange world.,2,2,0.011333333333333343
106,in a bit of a depressive episode,General_Lion5914,"recently i have been going thru a depressive episode in which i cannot stop thinking about the dogs that i had with my ex. it’ll be almost a year next month since the last time i’ve seen them and yes, i have to admit that keeping them away from me while i was in active addiction was the best thing my ex did bc now i am going on 3 months clean and although i will always be an addict for the rest of my life being and being in recovery has brought back so many things that i’ve lost and that includes my two dogs that my ex and i got, bailey and bowie. What really has me fucked up is that no matter how hard i try to reach out to my ex about what he needs from me so that i am able to see the dogs he has yet to respond to the many messages that i’ve sent to him. I don’t get it bc it was him who told me to that once i got clean that he would consider letting me see the dogs. and now here i am with 2 months cleans going on to 3 and i’ve heard nothing from him. i understand that it’s up to him whether or not to allow me to see the dogs but he knows exactly how much they mean to me and it breaks my heart that i haven’t heard anything abt them at all.
blake if u see this pls let me see bowie and bailey or at least lmk how they’re doing please",2,1,0.12476851851851856
107,"I'm not crazy. Or broken. I'm emotionally injured, and I can heal.",DryMntnMama,"I've been reading about emotional invalidation and its effect on someone's mental health. It's eye opening.


If we spend the majority of our time with someone who consistently invalidates everything we feel, there are some very detrimental side effects. It's a systematic breakdown of identity and self worth. And of course most of the time it's not intentional. It's actually usually well-meaning. 


Having emotions invalidated is being told, in some way, ""You shouldn't feel that way. It's wrong."" 


Here are some effects someone might experience when their emotions are consistently invalidated by a person they love and trust. 


- Feeling inferior

- Feeling like they're 'crazy'

- Diminished self-worth, self esteem, confidence

- Not trusting their emotions, wondering if they're 'wrong'

- Inability to regulate emotion

- Confusion about identity - uncertain about likes/dislikes, who they really are

- Feeling shame for needing emotional connection

- Withdrawal, hiding emotional state

- Difficult relationships

- Deep feeling of loneliness


I've spent a lot of time recognizing certain feelings, wondering where they come from, so that I can begin to work through them. I always feel inferior, in my marriage and friendships. I've been trying since last year to figure out what things I really like and enjoy - from hobbies to what I wear. I don't know who I am. It's a strange identity crisis that I couldn't figure out. Of course, I felt like my emotions were always wrong, too much, and needed to be turned off. I felt like I was crazy, broken, for not being able to figure out how to turn them off. So I drank.


It turns out I'm not crazy. Or broken. Just emotionally injured, and that's something I can heal from.

110,What’s your experience like being in recovery while in college?,Weak-Ostrich-4753,I’ve been in recovery for over a year and a half now. I came in at 19 while I was deep in my addiction. Recovery has completely changed my life in more ways than I can articulate. I’ve been sober for over a year and a half. Often times in my recovery I’ve felt that I was missing out because I had to avoid certain situations and activities with friends that could have threatened my recovery. I’m curious to know if anyone else has a similar experience as it pertains to being young or in college while in recovery.,6,2,0.03463203463203463
112,Help resisting urges?,eddiemomentos,"I’m having a really hard time not relapsing full on with cutting. As of recently I’ve picked up on pricking my skin but it’s not enough to fully ward off the urge to fully cut, and I already feel guilty for this sort of alternative way of self injury I’ve adopted- it feels like cheating. I’m out of motivation and I don’t feel any better, only more suicidal- I don’t really see a point in continuing other than I don’t want my partner to see my cuts if I were to relapse- how can I overcome these urges? I’ve tried calling friends, music, drawing, crafts, exercise and im still stuck

116,5 months 8 days sober and not really exited.,Plane-Record2562,So before thes 5 months and 8 days i went to rehab with about the same clean time before my few day relapse. I was worrying the whole time how i would get back here and it flew by and i didn’t expect to get here this quickly. I still don’t feel proud i already did this before without any fellowship in a terrible living situation my job was great that’s what kept me holding on for so long. Don’t know when it will get better shitty job i have the flu right now but i don’t actually feel any of the symptoms anymore so i’m very confused about how to feel.

118,8 years on MAT. Setback. Vent needed,prettylittlegrimm,"just started a new job and have had to use my methadone clinic gas money for work l. Day 3 no dose

Just wanted to vent. I see others have been going through similar stuff. I haven't missed a dose in like 3 years but boy it sucks. That sickness... The withdrawal .... The one I worked so hard to avoid has been creeping in. I've been staying strong but I may have to go another 2 days until I can get the gas money to dose. Been using OTC meds for now. Just wanted to vent. It's been so hard to still go to work this sick but I know this is only temporary 

SO happy to have a job again, though. It's an honest life saver to know that soon enough I will never have these issues again if I can help it. Remaining positive and no matter what I know I won't relapse",3,0,0.04994588744588745

120,I don’t agree with repetitive opinions but this.,FortheuserTronisreal,One is too many and a thousand is never enough. Says you. Damn newbie or old schooler. 😂 I can tell you. Situations always go down the same. But sometimes we actually do get “dope sick.” I know and believe a lot of strange stuff because of my trips. Almost as if I said “I’ve seen enough.” I won’t tell a single thing as not to encourage. But everything is real. Just because it’s a thought and not action makes it no less real on the grand scale. You decide when enough is enough. And sometimes and sometimes unfortunately. We’re forced to have enough. Trust me. There’s hope of you want out. But remember. Survival is nearly guaranteed in a 9 to 5 white collar job. We as addicts we have no structure. Our lives are extremely limited. For some and even most. We can easily be beaten by this world. Enough is enough. That’s what you decide. It may take awhile but 40 more is better than 1000. Let’s be real. Try 120 more. Hope you can make it less than I did. Be careful.,1,0,0.08241567460317462
122,feeling inadequate in life,TheMostAwkwardLion,"So I've been in a sober living community for 9 and a half months with almost 10 months clean. At this point I still need to work on my connection with God, but I have worked a complete 12 step program, have a sponsor and a couple sponsees, am the house senior of my apartment and really do my best to help the next man up that comes into the program. I've even found an outside home group and attend different outside meetings aside from the ones they have here. 

I feel as though the only thing I can do right is to stay clean and help others. Everything else in my life I'm way behind on. This includes being behind on finances, unstable mental health, i dont have a car and deoend on the programs transportation, working on a plan after leaving the program and lack of motivation to achieve my goals. I have lots of goals and ambitions in my life but I feel as though I am drained of energy to really go after those goals. It's like I'm doing everything I can for everyone else but I leave myself feeling empty at the end of the day and put back so many things i need to work on putting my recovery first and foremost. I don't know if I need to pull back some or what but I'd feel bad about not being there for others when I could be that guy that could help a fellow addict or alcoholic and giving back what was so freely given to me.

It's like I've put all of myself into this program and neglected myself in the process. Like I've lost a sense of identity. I'm only 24 and I know there's way more out there in the world to experience and there's so many things I wanna do. I want to continue helping others everywhere I go but I don't wanna be stuck where I'm at either. Maybe I just need to give it more time. I don't have the desire to use at all but I'm feeling depressed about this whole thing because although I'm recovered from drugs and alcohol, I'm feeling a bit miserable at the same time. If anyone has some experience, strength or hope about this I'd love to hear yours.

125,If people talk about you.,FortheuserTronisreal,It’s like these mfers sit back and disrespect and hope that just because they think something of you they can get a reaction. After awhile you really sit back. And think that they ain’t shit. And that you’ll destroy them if they try to take that away. The reason I write this is because I used to think there was a legit reason as to why people talk. Then as I begin to recover and educate myself. I begun to realize that the reactions you get from people are as many as stars you see in the sky. There’s a limit. But reactions are many and varied.  I’m glad I can understand these things today. Because from a stand point. You look at that person and think they must have nothing to do or are out to get me or there’s a million reasons. That’s the hardest part about it. Is trying to understand it. Don’t. Distance yourself. Do your thing. You’ll exit recovery. I did. Now I practice recovery. By myself but. I know that if I ever relapse and have to go back into recovery. That I have developed tools for myself.,2,0,0.14

129,Where to meet people?,Affectionate-Sock-62,"I've spent years working on my issues almost isolated. And I've reached a point where I'm finally feeling good, and I'm taking control of my life.

I'm feeling great, but I'm also feeling very lonely. I've broken out of the mindsets my family and people in my country have. I learned to think differently from what I was taught growing up. And in doing so I feel I can no longer connect with people around me.

I'm just, different now. It's not that I'm better, I've just learned how to think and feel for myself, for what I want and to take care of me. To have the kinds of thoughts I want and to sow the seeds of what I want more of in life.

We are just different now. I can't go back to what I was. And I feel very lonely.

I want to ask what do people do after recovery? Where do they go, where are they? What do they like? I figure if I find in those options something I like, I can give it a try and maybe find like-minded people to make friends with. Idk, someone who understands a little of what we go through.

Sounds weird I know but when I used , the drugs did exactly what they were suppose to do. Make me feel better. The fact of reality though is that my relationship had problems. My gf didn’t do everything I thought was right. I was challenged and angry. Didn’t want resistance or talk back. Just do this. But people are not substances.

132,My thoughts on Xmas.,FortheuserTronisreal,"Some may take offense to my idea because I don’t and I refuse to believe Jesus as god. I’d rather believe him a man who got swept into bad business. They beat him horribly. Take the god part out seriously. Ripped his beard out and stuff. A man who wanted to help and change the faith around him. I wake up grateful for simply being off drugs and having a decent life now. Never forget that, that could be you. This man took a major hit for all of us. My best advice for this holiday is to learn from all the grief it can bring. We are blessed not exactly by gos but by others mistakes. Some people we can read their stories or hear their stories. I encourage you to listen and make decisions based off others downfall. Sounds horrible but true. Believe anything you believe this holiday. As it’s never easy having the fantasy part along with losing family during this time. But the realty is. That this time of year is cold, a godly man paid dearly and we chose this story to make it through a hard time. As human beings we should always seek a higher purpose. If you saw Super Mario fall down and hole you should try to avoid that same hole. This time of the year is great but never forget the reality of how harsh this world used to be. It’s harsh but not nearly as cold as it could be. The beauty of god isn’t that n knowing there’s a god. Some simply believe. There’s some sort of part of me that is somehow forced to believe there’s some sort of rule that keeps everything working. Maybe it’s simply faith. You could put god in a chair in front of me. I’d refuse to believe. My mind wants to keep the mystery. I’d call that faith. Not belief. No less valuable. Believe what you believe and if it’s an unpopular opinion cherish it. Because rare opinions work under very specific circumstances. My main advice is don’t add fantasy to the fantasy. Drugs are terrible this time of year. Because under drugs we are often even more spiritual. It’s also cold. Get kicked out. Pass out somewhere. Seriously be careful this time of year. I’m bad enough to stand on my own believe my belief. And still respect god and religion. Same with my sobriety or whatever you want to call it. By the end of the day I found strength here, but I did observe my strength in addiction. Tempered it even. Through nonessential situations. Stray from the path and you’ll be guided back. But what if that time you were not there? Sounds familiar? Humans are more extraordinary than any god walking.

136,Day 2: refund? What refund?,GonnaEatThatPickle," So. Exciting morning. Couldn’t sleep all night. I had found a job in Tampa and had the perfect plan. Ha ha ha the perfect plan. So foolproof, I asked mom for $10, and happily got breakfast. 

I had accepted a shift gig over in Tampa. I had the right clothes. I had the right energy. I had the right oomph. The most perfect laid out minute by minute plan in my head it was going to easy and beautiful! 

I went to the front desk and this gorgeous young lady, who is also incredibly sweet but I’m gonna give a shout out in a bit, got me all set, checked me out  and assured me all funds were released. Awesome. Thats the $50 security deposit and $55 for refund for the night I cancelled, tonight. Once the money was released from both “Rosen Inn Near The Parks” and Booking.Com ( which I LOVE and recommend) I Sat in lobby with my backpack, my rollercase and a grocery bag that I eventually emptied into my back pack.  I only had to wait for chime to put it back into my account. I mean things were going so well, that sitting across from me in the lobby, was only the most tasty looking European God I have laid eyes on!(since Key West)..

I enjoy the hunt and game. It’s the only hunting safari id have the nerve to on and come home with a trophy. 

So here I am, you know, making myself look busy, which in turn just made me look fidgety, and desperate and don’t forget the drool sliding between and out of my lips. I focused. Kinda. And got out of there. 

I got up and headed to the bus stop, the first of many in a 4 hour long bus ride to tampa. My nice, only black button down I have, clinging to my backpack so it’s easy for me to grab when I get there ( or if I need to look important somewhere) and wear tonight. 

Bus comes, I hurry onto the bus, next bus Next bus, 2 hours, and I left my blackshirt and blue tie on ground of bus stop Bud driver wants fare. I begin looking for my wallet which holds the $16 week pass for transit, wallets gone. Not in my bags, no where. I jump off bus, calling hotel. I get back, it’s not in lobby, not in room, it’s just gone. In the meantime im stay on phone for 6 hours trying to get “Chime” to just tease the other refund. Get this, they are so confused over the two transactions, a couple supervisors are considering their chosen career path. They were all friendly, just….how many people do I have to explain it to for them to get it. They’ve sent one refund not two. 

It 8:21. I’ve gotten one of the refunds back. Enough to get a room back exactly where I started. Inside at least and guess I’ll have to fast tonight cause that took my last penny. 

I gotta say and give a shout out to the this WONDERFUL Hotel and the entire front desk staff of “The Rosen Hotel Near The Parks” on International in Orlando. The place is clean and the staff truly are so helpful and lovely!

So. I will wait and see what happens next. I gotta figure out a way to get through tomorrow while still achieving something. Im still optimistic. I’m determined that this time, it’s gonna work! 

Wish me Love! xoxo😘",1,0,0.1693298680974737
137,7 days clean.,sllyerr69,I don’t have anyone else to tell because nobody else knows about my addiction so I wanted to post this here. I’m 7 days clean from fent today and I’m still not sure how I feel about it. I’m happy about it but at the same time It’s been a big struggle both physically (terrible) and mentally (even worse). I feel like I don’t even know who I really am anymore. Or who I ever really was. It’s really hard trying to do this by myself and I’m terrified that I’m going to relapse again. Any advice?,28,26,-0.043181818181818175

139,Time too be a big boy,GonnaEatThatPickle," Well, you know that moment you gotta pee really bad because your so darn excited about what’s happening or happening next or what’s gonna happen? This is NOT one of them. My name is Caleb and as of today, I’m throwing myself to the mercy of Destiny & Fate. Hoping they have a brilliant turn of events in store for me, as I am an addict who’s made quit the mess yet again. When I’m using, I never fail to mess my life up completely up & generally take a few unknowing people with me. It’s really quit the shit show. Let’s hope we just hear some of the past stories and not make any new ones pertaining to my dope days. I need to be clean. I need to be sober. I need to find stability. 

So I begin my journey, with no plan completely established, $160 & a q of grass. It’s a 4 hour bus ride so sadly, I took the earbuds of my mothers desk so I could use them. See, in my head, she would have said yes or got me a pair. In reality, Ive taken so much, she would have hesitated, but given them to me anyway. 

And at that I must stop for a bit. I seem to have a leak in my eye. Unfortunately, according to my therapist, there will be many leaks,breaks, dam bursts and  a typhoon possibly. Thats what he hopes for. I guess in a way, I do too, but it only works if I am completly honest to you, my liberators, if you will. 

I consider you liberators because if I do in fact do this right, you will be freeing the “true me”from shadows. From darkness. From despair. From pain and every word that resonates with demons & evil & sadness. The problem is you will then know all I once was and all I hope to leave behind. Don’t let my struggle with my demons darken or sadden your soul,I need to be a big boy now, if not for any other reason, for my mother.  I do see hope at the of my tunnel. And Blueberry pie.
